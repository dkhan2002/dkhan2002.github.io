Hello. My name is Deena and my Twine narrative is a fun story with Henry VIII as the main character. Even though I personally enjoy history I know it can get a little boring for others so I decided to take a more fun route with my story. I allow the player to make choices of their own which can lead to different outcomes and also they can put their own input for some choices so this way they can stay engaged. I have also added some images, colored texts, and a map so my story doesn't look boring or bland and making it a little pleasing to the eyes. I really enjoyed making this story and I'm really proud of how well I did on it and hopefully you feel the same! :)
